## Summary
The striated caracara (_Phalcoboenus australis_) is a bird of prey :eagle: endemic to islands in southern Argentina and Chile. The species is listed as [Near Threatened](http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/striated-caracara-phalcoboenus-australis)
and does not currently face recognizable threats or population reductions; however, their status may be underestimated, since the assessment almost exclusively used 
data from one population. Several parameters indicate a much more vulnerable situation that previously thought in the Fuegian archipelago. Importantly, 
we follow [IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org) standards to estimate the Area of Occurrence (AOO) using an open-source pipeline based on the [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) database. The AOO estimate is sufficient 
to reassess the species’ status to Vulnerable, when coupled with indicators of reduction and fragmentation suggested by fieldwork on Isla de los Estados. 
More importantly, our open-source and freely available workflow can be updated in real time as more information becomes available in the [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) database, creating an 
invaluable application for GBIF toward future species assessments. 

Here you will find a workflow that uses only free, open access and reproducible data and methods for estimating AOO of this species. 
Importantly, the workflow can be updated as more information is added to the [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) database.
